Pi-hole is a network-level ad and malware blocker. Due to some hardware issues in the past, I've had to do this process a few times, collecting steps from around the internet each time. Rather than have to compile steps from a variety of different sources next time, the steps in this doc describe how I set up Pi-hole with:

- Raspberry Pi 4
- Unbound recursive DNS with Cloudflare DNS for fallback
- Block and allowlists maintained via [pi-hole-updatelists](https://github.com/jacklul/pihole-updatelists)
- A cron job and script to automate maintenance
- Local Omada router and controller

The steps in this doc include a fresh install of Raspberry Pi OS to host the Pi-hole. If you already have a device with a Debian-based operating system, skip to [Install Pi-hole](pi-hole/install-configure#install-pi-hole).

This doc is made to be a copy and paste solution for my set of preferences and hardware. Visit [the official Pi-hole documentation](https://docs.pi-hole.net/) for other use-cases and details.

## Prerequisites

- [Raspberry Pi 4](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)
- microSD card 4GB or larger
  - A way to plug it into a computer to get it set up.
- Familiarity with a terminal application and the command line.
