## Install Software Locally

- [SD Card Formatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter/)
  - Install using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install --cask sdformatter`
- [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
  - Install using Homebrew: `brew install --cask raspberry-pi-imager`

## Format the SD Card

:::caution
This process erases everything on the SD card.
:::

<Steps>

1. Insert a microSD card, then Open SD Card Formatter and choose the card from the **Select card** dropdown.
1. Select **Format** to format the card.
   - The default settings are fine: Quick format and no volume label.

</Steps>

## Create the Pi OS Image on the SD Card

Raspberry Pi Imager makes the SD card a bootable drive.

<Steps>

1. Open Raspberry Pi Imager
1. **Choose Device**: Raspberry Pi 4
1. **Choose OS**: Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit)
1. **Choose Storage** to select the SD card
1. **Next**

</Steps>

### Configure Raspberry Pi Imager Settings

<Steps>

1. In the **Use OS customisation?** popup that appears, select **EDIT SETTINGS**. If the device you're using is connected to Wi-Fi, a prompt will ask if you'd like to use the Wi-Fi password from the system pre-filled in the Customisation screen. If you don't pre-fill it, you can still enter it on the next screen.

   ![Raspberry Pi Imager OS Customisation window with all options checked in the General tab.](@img/r-pi-imager-customisation.png)

1. In the **GENERAL** tab, make your selections. Use your own easy-to-remember username and password:

   - **☑ Set hostname**: `pi-hole`.local
   - **☑ Set username and password**
     - **☑ Username**: `probablyedward`
     - **☑ Password**: `probablyhunter2`
   - **☑ Configure wireless LAN** (only if you're not using Ethernet)
   - **Set locale settings**

1. In the **SERVICES** tab:

   - **☑ Enable SSH** and **☑ Use password authentication**

1. In the **OPTIONS** tab:

   - Uncheck **Enable telemetry**

1. Select **Save**

1. Plug it in and give it a minute to load.

</Steps>

## Find the Pi's IP Address

If you configured Wi-Fi and plugged the Pi in via Ethernet, your Pi will have two IP addresses.
To make it easier to [enable network-wide blocking](#configure-the-omada-controller-to-enable-network-wide-blocking-with-pi-hole) later, identify the Pi's Ethernet IP address.

For me, I use a TP-Link Omada controller:

<Steps>

1. Log in and select the site's name.
1. Select **Clients** then **Wired** to filter the table of connected clients.
1. Select **pi-hole** in the **USERNAME** column to open the **Details** sidebar.
1. Select **Config** and check **☑ Use Fixed IP Address**.

</Steps>

## Install Pi-hole

<details>

  <summary>If you skipped to this section, expand this for things to look out for.</summary>

  If you installed Pi-hole on an existing device or skipped to this section

  OS-specific things that might be different for your setup:
    - Installed software like Git, curl, or zsh
    - `apt` package manager. Your OS might use a different one.
    - User accounts. The examples I use are `probablyedward` and `pi`

</details>

Replace the username, `probablyedward`, and example IP, `192.0.2.25`, in these steps with your Pi's username and local IP.

<Steps>

1. Open your terminal app and SSH to the Pi:

   ```shell
   ssh probablyedward@192.0.2.25
   ```

   Enter the password when prompted.

1. Update the system and install dependencies:

   ```shell
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   sudo apt install git php-cli php-sqlite3 php-intl php-curl unbound
   ```

   Enter the password when prompted. This is the point at which I also configure my command line interface (CLI) and editor, but that's outside the scope of this doc.

1. Run the Pi-hole installation script:

   ```shell
   curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
   ```

1. The script will prompt you with a number of warnings and options. When prompted select:

   - **Choose An Interface**: `eth0` for Ethernet.
   - **Static IP Address**: `Yes` and enter the IP address you found in [Find the Pi's IP Address](#find-the-pis-ip-address).
     - Unless you've made specific changes to the network, the gateway address should be the IP of the router or controller. In this example, that's `192.0.2.1`.
   - **Upstream DNS Provider**: Select `Cloudflare` for now. This is a setting we'll change later, but we select [Cloudflare's DNS server](https://one.one.one.one/dns#explanation) now so that every DNS request from the Pi going forward will be routed through a trusted directory.
   - **Blocklists**: `Yes` to use the default list.
   - **Admin Web Interface**: `Yes` to install the Pi-hole web interface.
     - **Web Server**: `Yes` to install lightppd for the web interface.
   - **Enable Logging**: `Yes` to enable query logging. This helps diagnose issues like when Hulu or Disney+ won't load on your smart TV.
     - **Select a privacy mode**: `0` to show what site got blocked on which device. Consult the [official Pi-hole docs](https://docs.pi-hole.net/ftldns/privacylevels/) for more information about the privacy levels.

   The last screen lists the IP and a temporary password for the Pi-hole web interface. Since we'll change it in the next step, it's safe to ignore this.

1. Change the temporary password. Change the `examplePassword` in this example:

   ```shell
   pihole -a -p examplePassword
   ```

1. Optional: Follow the steps in the official [Pi-hole documentation to configure unbound](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/#configure-unbound).

   This step is optional because the Pi-hole is already configured to use Cloudflare's DNS provider. Use unbound if you prefer a [recursive DNS server](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/dns/unbound/#what-is-a-recursive-dns-server).

1. Log in to the Pi-hole web interface: [http://pi.hole/admin](http://pi.hole/admin).
