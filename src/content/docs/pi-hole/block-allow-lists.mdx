The steps here use the pihole-updatelists script. The official [pihole-updatelists documentation](https://github.com/jacklul/pihole-updatelists#update-pi-holes-lists-from-remote-sources) includes information about other configuration options if you prefer to use Docker or would rather avoid piping to bash.

:::tip Language is important
This doc uses the words `whitelist` and `blacklist` to match the way the Pi-hole deals with allowlists and blocklists. So while descriptions of their actions here will be `allowlist` and `blocklist`, I'll use `whitelist` and `blacklist` when it matches text to edit.
:::

Configure the Pi-hole to use a script from [GitHub user jacklul](https://github.com/jacklul/pihole-updatelists#update-pi-holes-lists-from-remote-sources) to apply:

- Blocklists from:
  - [The Firebog](https://firebog.net/)
  - [StevenBlack/hosts](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts)
  - [mmotti/pihole-regex](https://github.com/mmotti/pihole-regex/)

- Allowlists from:
  - [anudeepND](https://github.com/anudeepND/whitelist)
  - [mmotti/pihole-regex](https://github.com/mmotti/pihole-regex/)

1. Download and run the pihole-updatelists script:

   ```zsh
   wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacklul/pihole-updatelists/master/install.sh | sudo bash
   ```

1. Edit the configuration file to match:
