## Updates

Update the Pi-hole's OS, software, and lists with:

```zsh
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
pihole -up -y
sudo /usr/local/sbin/pihole-updatelists
```

### Create a Script to Update the Pi-Hole and Lists Automatically

Put the update commands into a script so that you can run it from cron and assign it an alias. This gives you a central location from which to maintain the commands that run:

1. Create the script:

   ```zsh
   touch ~/.pi-hole-update.sh
   ```

1. Edit the file to include:

   ```zsh title="~/.pi-hole-update.sh" showLineNumbers
   #!/bin/zsh

   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   pihole -up -y
   sudo /usr/local/sbin/pihole-updatelists
   ```

   If you're using Bash instead of Zsh, replace `#!/bin/zsh` with `#!/bin/sh`.

1. Add a new cron job that runs the script every Sunday morning at 03:00. Edit `/etc/crontab` to add this line:

   ```shell title="/etc/crontab"
   0  3    * * * 0 pi      ~/.pi-hole-update.sh
   ```

1. To run the updater script whenever you want, create an `update!` alias. Add this line to `~/.zshrc` (or if you're using Bash, to `~/.bashrc`):

   ```zsh title="~/.zshrc"
   alias update!='. ~/.pi-hole-update.sh'
   ```

## Configure the Omada Controller to Enable Network-Wide Blocking with Pi-Hole

Configure the Omada controller and set the DNS server to use the Pi's IP address.

1. Log in to the controller and click the site's name.
1. Click the **Settings** cog then **Wired Networks** and click the edit icon for the network name that should use the Pi-hole.
1. Next to **DHCP Server**, select **☑ Enable** to expand the DHCP options.
1. Next to **DNS Server**, select **Manual** and enter the Pi-hole's IP address into the first box. In the second box, enter `1.1.1.1` to use Cloudflare's DNS as a backup.
