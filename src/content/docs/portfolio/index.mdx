Selected examples of technical writing and documentation work, organized by project type and approach.

## Process Documentation

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Contributor PR Workflow" icon="github">
		**Pantheon Internal Guide**

		Created workflow documentation for technical writers collaborating with external contributors on GitHub PRs. Solved a recurring problem where writers needed to work on contributor branches but lacked clear steps.

		Approach: Documented the Git commands and GitHub workflow, then tested with team members to refine the process.

		[Internal Confluence Guide (PDF)](/pdfs/Edward-Angert-Pantheon-Confluence-work-on-a-contributor-PR-in-the-docs-repository.pdf)
	</Card>

	<Card title="GitLab First Contribution" icon="gitlab">
		**GitLab Community Documentation**

		Overhauled the "Make a GitLab contribution" tutorial to reduce barriers for new contributors. The original process was intimidating and scattered across multiple pages.

		Approach: Reorganized into sequential steps, added new contribution methods (Web IDE, Gitpod, GDK-in-a-box), and tested each path.

## Technical Setup Guides

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="WordPress Remote Database" icon="seti:db">
		**Linode Customer Documentation**

		Developed comprehensive guide for configuring WordPress with remote databases. Started with a support engineer's outline, then researched, tested, and documented the complete process.

		Approach: Built test environment, documented each step, gathered feedback from docs team, refined based on customer questions.

	</Card>

	<Card title="Pi-hole Network Setup" icon="laptop">
		**Personal Reference Documentation**

		Comprehensive guide covering Pi-hole installation, configuration, and network-wide ad blocking. Created after repeatedly setting this up due to hardware issues and helping others with the process.

		Approach: Documented each setup iteration, organized into logical sequence, included troubleshooting steps.

## Technical Illustration

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Multizone Failover Diagram" icon="puzzle">
		**Pantheon Technical Documentation**

		Collaborated with design team to create visual representation of complex multizone failover architecture. Needed to explain technical concept that was difficult to understand from text alone.

		Approach: Created initial draft based on engineering feedback, worked with design team for final version, integrated into customer documentation.
