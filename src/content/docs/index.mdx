Technical Writer, team leader, and tinkerer with 10 years of experience writing, editing, and maintaining developer-centered documentation and technical content strategy for cloud-based services.

Skilled in collaborating with remote, cross-functional teams to create clear and comprehensive content. Making things a little better in every way I can.
