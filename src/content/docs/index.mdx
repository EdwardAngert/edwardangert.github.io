Hello, this is Edward!

Technical Writer, team leader, and perpetual tinkerer who's always learning something new and figuring out how to make things work.
I love empowering people and teams by simplifying processes and sharing knowledge.

Part of my resume is available on the [resume page](/about/resume/), and the rest of this site has documentation I've put together for fun, like how I [implement Pi-hole at home](/docs/pi-hole/).

Connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-angert/) or set up a time to talk through [my cal.com link](https://cal.com/edwardangert).

If you encounter an issue or typo, please [submit a GitHub issue](https://github.com/EdwardAngert/edwardangert.github.io/issues/new) or pull request.
