Hello, this is Edward!

Documentation team manager and Technical Writer with 10 years of experience in developer and customer-centered documentation, information architecture, and creating a docs-first culture across globally distributed teams.

I'm a perpetual tinkerer who learns by doing, whether it's setting up my home server, scripting workflows using AI tools like Claude Code, or dismantling things to understand how they work.

I help people share their knowledge and expertise by making it easier to contribute, find, and trust documentation. I love empowering users no matter where they sit in the audience--internal or external--through testing, transparency, and making things easy to understand (or at least easy to copy and paste).

Part of my resume is available on the [resume page](/about/resume/), and the rest of this site has documentation I've put together for fun, like how I [implement Pi-hole at home](/docs/pi-hole/).

Connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-angert/) or set up a time to talk through [my cal.com link](https://cal.com/edwardangert).

If you encounter an issue or typo, please [submit a GitHub issue](https://github.com/EdwardAngert/edwardangert.github.io/issues/new) or pull request.
