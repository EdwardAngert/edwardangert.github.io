Hello, this is Edward!

Documentation leader who assesses what exists, identifies what's needed, and builds systems that work.

Ten years creating developer-focused documentation, information architecture, and scalable workflows across globally distributed teams.
I transform fragmented documentation into coherent user journeys and establish trusted docs-first processes that teams adopt and sustain.

I'm a perpetual tinkerer who learns by doing, whether it's setting up my home server, scripting workflows using AI tools like Claude Code, or dismantling things to understand how they work.

I help people share their knowledge and expertise by making it easier to contribute, find, and trust documentation.
I love empowering users no matter where they sit in the audience--internal or external--through testing, transparency, and making things easy to understand (or at least easy to copy and paste).

Check out my [work samples](/portfolio/) to see documentation I've created, from [quickstart guides](/portfolio/coder-quickstart/) to [contributor tutorials](/portfolio/gitlab-first-contribution/).
My abridged [resume](/about/resume/) has the career timeline, and I've also documented projects I've built for fun, like [implementing Pi-hole at home](/docs/pi-hole/).

Connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/edward-angert/) or set up a time to talk through [my cal.com link](https://cal.com/edwardangert).

If you encounter an issue or typo, please [submit a GitHub issue](https://github.com/EdwardAngert/edwardangert.github.io/issues/new) or pull request.
