      "We all--humans and AI--need good documentation."

I've been using Claude and Claude Code both at home and at work.

Gemini on my phone to identify plants and bugs, and ChatGPT to show me what my dog would look like as a puppy or dressed as Elphaba.

- Which of these water bottles fit in my car's cup holder?
- Is this poison ivy?
- What's this broken part of our toilet called?
- How much plywood do I need for this project?
- Help me turn my settings into dotfiles.
- Is this rash poison ivy?
- I have a Docusaurus site hosted through GitHub Pages. Let's develop a plan to migrate it to Astro with Starlight.

When I started a new job recently, I could have made a spreadsheet of all the available health insurance options, variables, and possibilities.
I fed it all into ChatGPT and asked for a personalized table with cost breakdowns.

For me, the great promise of AI is that it can make sense of piles of information that would take me hours to untangle and map out.
If AI has all the information, can it write the documentation for me?

## AI can document things; Humans are better at writing documentation

When I write documentation, I take all the information I have from my own notes, from product managers, and the several threads from Slack in which someone said `@Edward ☝️` and read through it all, following threads and connecting the dots.
With AI, I paste all the information into a window and ask, "What got decided here and what do I need to do about it?"
Claude lays out a plan, and if I'm using Claude Code, we dig deeper into the codebase or Git branch for the context I need.

Context, relationships, and information synthesis all help technical writers make better documentation.
Usually we get that from subject matter experts (SME) and poking around in codebases or being in every Slack channel ever.

If my AI tool has access to all of these, shouldn't it be able to write the documentation itself?

It tries.
It can make a great outline, but it seems to have trouble navigating what [kind of technical documentation to write](https://idratherbewriting.com/blog/what-is-diataxis-documentation-framework), and always wants to use headings with step numbers and emojis.

It's not just that the documentation is wrong (sometimes it is), it's just... _off_.

AI is missing--at least for now--that magical blend of curiosity and empathy that helps technical writers anticipate their audience's needs.
It's fantastic at parsing content that is there, and it tries to imitate [abductive reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning) as best as it can.
Maybe that's why it "hallucinates" technical content - it's trying to guess, very much like I would, and it can get to the right answer, but it needs be to babysat, coaxed, coached, and led.

But while AI agents aren't great at writing technical documentation (yet), they are a great aid.

Maybe aide is more appropriate.
Claude Code is my SME, my always-at-hand assistant, my [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), and regex expert.

## Know your audience

While I was working on a pull request for a new Coder feature, I used Claude Code to there were a few times that Claude Code offered my own documentation as a reference, so it seems to work _because_ of well-written documentation.

My job has always been to empower users to get stuff done smoothly and on their own.

If humans and AI both rely on good documentation, how do I develop documentation and an information architecture that helps both?

Great technical writers help their subject matter experts give better information.

We're a curious bunch who want to help experts deliver and empower users to make the most of whatever it is.
A whole field of people who love learning and helping people succeed, even though we'll never get to see.

I'm sure there will be advancements that feel threatening, and there will be companies that try to eschew a documentation and education function to "have someone else do it," as there always are.

AI agents are becoming our technical analogues and companions, and as it is with some engineering teams, technical writers will find ways that they augment and accelerate our work; not supplant us.
